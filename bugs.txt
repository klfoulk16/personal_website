Ideas:
-- Give the posts slugs so that instead of displaying the post ID the URL will be the slug.
- Should I implement tags? So that within code/other people can look at exactly the type of thing that interests them?
- When does a user get automatically logged out??

Bugs:
- Subscribe should open up a new page congratulating them on subscribing. Right now the method is not good.
- Can't add more than 1mb of images to a post. Want no one image to be above 1mb but total they can.
- Adding images to email will be very finicky.
- refactor subscribe flow
- should I switch the admin user to an environment variable??
- post body should not be allowed to be none
- post location in the laptop is based off the number of posts currently in the database, not the real id. need to just get rid of this.
- should not be able to open route 'edit' for a post that has been deleted or doesn't exist.
- can't edit category
- can access /edit route without admin priviliges just not edit/id
- if most routes don't exist there's no 404 page not found error - it just takes you to a blank page
- turn post headers to links in index/categories
- migrate db to aware datetimes with an hour
- old images are not removed from file system if the post is edited to get rid of them...is this how I want things to work?
- if you don't enter a message body (only html) you'll get a server error
