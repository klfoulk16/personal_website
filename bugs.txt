Bugs:
-Unordered lists don't have bullet points.
-Footer doesn't stay at the bottom.
-Go back and add a new email address to
- Subscribe doesn't seem to be working

Fixed:
1.The dates don't all convert pretty in the code page.
-added .all() after db query.

2. Display most recent posts first instead of oldest posts first in layouts.
- Used posts = Posts.query.order_by(Posts.id.desc()).all()

3. I want the subscribe modal link to display "Success!" when a user subscribes. Not redirect to a new page.
-Used some javascript. But it'll display success even if the route doesn't run.
