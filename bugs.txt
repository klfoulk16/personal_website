Getting this error when I click around a lot:
sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError

To begin a new transaction with this Session, first issue Session.rollback(). Original exception was: (raised as a result of Query-invoked autoflush; consider using a session.no_autoflush block if this flush is occurring prematurely)

CONTEXT:  while updating tuple (0,6) in relation "posts"

[SQL: UPDATE posts SET date=%(date)s WHERE posts.id = %(posts_id)s]
[parameters: {'date': 'December 01, 2020', 'posts_id': 2}]

Fixed:
1.The dates don't all convert pretty in the code page.
-added .all() after db query.

2. Display most recent posts first instead of oldest posts first in layouts.
- Used posts = Posts.query.order_by(Posts.id.desc()).all()

3. I want the subscribe modal link to display "Success!" when a user subscribes. Not redirect to a new page.
-Used some javascript. But it'll display success even if the route doesn't run.
