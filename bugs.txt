Bugs:
Unordered lists don't have bullet points.
Footer doesn't stay at the bottom.

Fixed:
1.The dates don't all convert pretty in the code page.
-added .all() after db query.

2. Display most recent posts first instead of oldest posts first in layouts.
- Used posts = Posts.query.order_by(Posts.id.desc()).all()
