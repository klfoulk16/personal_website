"""What to Test?
What should you test?

Again, unit tests should focus on testing small units of code in isolation.

For example, in a Flask app, you may use unit tests to test:

Database models
Utility functions that your view functions call
Functional tests, meanwhile, should focus on how the view functions operate.

For example:

Nominal conditions (GET, POST, etc.) for a view function
Invalid HTTP methods are handled properly for a view function
Invalid data is passed to a view function
Focus on testing scenarios that the end user will interact with. The experience that the users of your product have is paramount!"""
