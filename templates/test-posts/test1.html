Sample:
Welcome to my blog! Here you'll find updates about the latest coding (and other!) projects I'm cooking up. Stay tuned for python, climbing and more!


<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>Welcome to my new blog. I plan to use this blog as a platform to share my coding projects and life adventures. In the code section you will find expanations of my projects and well as my attempt to explain various programming ins and outs.</p>

<p>For each project I will explain:</p>

<ol>
    <li>What the project does</li>
    <li>Why I decided to make the project
        <ul>
            <li>What did I want to learn/practice?</li>
            <li>Was this for practical use?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>How the project works</li>
    <li>Anything else I found interesting</li>
</ol>

<p>Besides code, I envision sharing brief updates on where I've been traveling, climbing, hiking, etc. I envision this being mainly pictures. Maybe I'll share some non-tech project I've got going on. Who knows - basically whatever's floating my boat at the minute.</p>
