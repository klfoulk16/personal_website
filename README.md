My personal website.

## Features to add:
1. RC Scout
2. Image Storage on S3 (or other solution)
3. Post preview in new tab
4. Schedule posts
5. Create the 'Edit' template ui to allow user to select which post to edit
6. Ability to display code snippets
7. Post tags
8. And lots more. See my bugs.txt file for more ideas.

Note: There will be some major refactoring of the structure of this app in the coming weeks.
